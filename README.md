# Burger


Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Once submitted, the application will display the burger on the left side--waiting to be devoured. When the user clicks the "Devour" button, the burger will move to the right side of the page. All burgers are displayed in the database.
